    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    <p>In this example, the &lt;h1&gt; styles of all pages comes from its own style file.</p>
    <p>Also, if you open the console, you will see a message with the name of the page. This message comes from the script file that is requested to be called at the end of the page's html.</p>
    <p>That script file runs again every time the page is updated.</p>
